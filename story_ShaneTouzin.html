				<div class="storyBody"><p>Alexander rereads the text message from Tris: &ldquo;I had a nice time too. You&rsquo;re really cute and fun to talk to. I&rsquo;m just not sure if we had the connection I was looking for. So I don&rsquo;t know if dinner would be the best idea. I honestly wish you all the best&rdquo;. He reruns the date in his mind over and over. Had he texted her too soon? Had he misread her? Why did she give him her phone number after the date if she wasn&rsquo;t into him? Did she decide later she didn&rsquo;t like him? Was it because he hugged her and she wanted a kiss? </p>

<p>He scrolls through his Instagram and SocialLife feeds looking at updates, shared articles, and memes of his old acquaintances. An old co-worker&rsquo;s toddler&rsquo;s birthday party scrolls across the screen. He feels bad for the child, knowing her mother to be irresponsible and her father to be an idiot. His good friend&rsquo;s wife is sharing a recipe for health conscious pretzels which makes him slightly jealous but principally filled with a vicarious sense of happiness. He knows they married young due to an unplanned child. The struggle they overcame to be able to make those gluten-free, dairy-free, and taste-free pretzels. He opens a new tab for the dating app he frequents so he can make another attempt at the type of life that brings homemade health conscious tasteless pretzels. </p>

<p>Alexander opens an incognito tab and types the address of a porn site into his browser. He hovers his mouse over slideshows of writhing and contorted bodies. He settles on a tall pale blonde girl partly because he recognizes her from previous sessions, but mostly because Tris is short and brunette. He is not able finish and stops when he feels an acute sense of shame which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and insecurity. It had been a good date. His failure to get a follow up dents his already underwhelming confidence, a trait which he knows is critical to making a woman desire a man.</p>

<p>He searches the name of the app into his engine. Scrolling down the page he sees the familiarly formatted text and picture boxes. He moves his mouse to the sites link and, though usually unfazed by the advertising which permeated everyone&rsquo;s life, sees something appealing. Above the link to the site was a box that read: &ldquo;Solve dating troubles with Cupidious. An A.I. solution to dating difficulties.&rdquo; Alexander shakes his head and returns to the dating site. </p>

<p> Pictures of women of all types glow on his screen. There are women with modern and classically styled tattoos. Tall girls, short girls, girls with naturally colored hair and girls with extreme fluorescent dye jobs. He unironically considers them and their written bios if he were even slightly attracted to them. He imagines their first date and where he would try to take them. He thinks about what styles of music he'd play them. What would he be wearing, and what would she be wearing? All these realities and more cross his mind as well as the negative ones. The ones where they chew him up and spit him out. Use him for money or a free meal or to get back at an ex. Or worse, like Tris, give him false hope that something more will come but never does. Alexander closes the browser and pulls his pants back up from around his knees.</p>

<p> Alexander orders from the Epicurean Desires menu from his terminal and enters chicken cordon bleu. The original recipe is sourced from Nice, France, and has been improved by 750,000 reiterations of machine learning trails matched to Filipino and Ukrainian biofeedbackers. </p>

<p> Impulsively Alexander enters &ldquo;Health Pretzel&rdquo; into the search bar and several recipes light up indicating that he has the ingredients. Naturally he chooses the highest taste rated and places the order.</p>

<p>He walks across his apartment floor made of repurposed leather belts arranged in a cross hatch pattern. The apartment is sparsely decorated with floor-to-ceiling one way glass windows that overlook the downtown area of the small city. Alexander sits on the foot of his queen sized foam mattress and meditates. </p>

<p>He tries to throw away the thoughts of inadequacy. He is a successful man, he has a good job programming user interfaces. He is paid well. He is independant. But, he still feels like a fraud. He feels like an imposter in this world, like everybody knows a secret that he was never told. </p>

<p>He thinks of nothing but breathing. In and out. In and out. </p>

<p>Alone, he is alone here and there is no one out there for him. What the poet&rsquo;s write about and what pop songs sing about he will never taste. </p>

<p>Breathing.</p>

<p>[Now he is replaying old awkward memories. When he sunk a conversation, when he saw that an acquaintance of his never ever respected him.] This section is a little confusing. Back to breathing.</p>

<p> A harmonic beep from his doorway frees the man from his attempt at meditation.</p>

<p> He opens the drawer on his glass topped bedside table and he takes out two bottles of prescription capsules. He swallows one of each and walks back across the leather floor to the door.</p>

<p> He sits in front of his screen back to selecting the proper porn thumbnail to watch while he eats the warm pretzel with his left hand. He concludes the pretzel must be thoroughly more satiating than that which his friend&rsquo;s spouse made. </p>

<p>After finishing to a video of a french girl and two guys, Alexander returns to the search screen and enters the dating apps title. Again, before clicking through to the site he stops on the ad: &ldquo;Cupidious. An A.I. solution to dating difficulties&rdquo;. More intrigued by the technology than the women, he returns to the search bar and enters: &ldquo;Cupidious review.&rdquo; Alex reactively clicks the top result and it takes him to a listicle titled &ldquo;Dating with A.I.: Reviews and ranking of dating A.I. systems&rdquo;. There are four entries to the list. </p>

<p> 3. HookLineAndWinHer: The original machine learning wingman application HookLineAndWinHer uses its years of entries to examine dating profiles from a wide variety of sites to allow the man to send the best flirtatious messages to get those girls on dates. However, that is as far as the application goes, unlike other entries on our list HookLineAndWinHer, and it will not actually help you be the interesting or dynamic person that the messages communicate. This, as well as its barring non-lesbian female users is why it is derided by the gentler gender. When this app was first introduced it was incredibly common for women to deride the &ldquo;Hookers&rdquo; they met dating online that failed to meet expectations.</p>

<p> 2. WingBot: WingBot is the handy and mostly harmless wingman app which you could ask advice from while your date was in the bathroom or otherwise occupied. The premium version of this app has an always listening version while the free version requires manual text entry for your escapades. WingBot has a large database full of conversation starters, jokes, and specialized dating ideas. The disadvantage to this system is that in order to get the most power out of it, the user is required to be especially studious and mindful to update the app with new data about your date&rsquo;s thoughts, likes, dislikes, and flirtatious signals which many of those who need to use an A.I. for dating are unaware of.</p>

<p> 1. Cupidious: This new venture is a very powerful and involved A.I. (and very expensive). Cupidious is with you every step of the way from the initial messages to its procedurally generated jewelry camera and Cupidious inner ear webbing which gives specific and detailed instructions to the user from audio and video. Cupidious is very powerful: you will get laid, you will have great dates, you will get out of the rut. However, Cupidious is so powerful you may never want to turn it off. More than one reviewer have suffered serious mental health consequences from this A. I. and all users are required to pass an application with the company in order to qualify as well as sign an indemnification clause with the Cupidious corporation so they avoid liability. </p>

<p> Alexander rereads the text message from Tris again. He had thought the date went so well. He just could not understand. He deletes the message and the contact information and then reaches for his wallet.</p>

<p> Alexander arrives at his apartment complex after nine hours of work. His mailbox glows but he already knows the package has arrived from incessant tracking on his phone. He rushes up eight stories of stairs that he chooses to climb every time he gets home from work. At his apartment his heart rate is doubly elevated. The package opens easily. </p>

<p>On top is a booklet with a silhouette of a cherub that looks like it could be a gym or high school team logo. Alexander holds his phone over the booklet to auto play the instructions on his phone. </p>

<p>Place the Cupidious inner ear webbing into your ear. </p>

<p>Alexander follows the instruction. </p>

<p>Choose a voice.</p>

<p> Alexander chooses female. A voice with a soothing but stern English accent says: &ldquo;Hello Alexander, I am Q, I will be your guide to eternal love. Please place the bracelet on your left wrist.&rdquo; Alexander begins to put on a grey and blue bracelet with a obsidian clasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bracelet was chosen for you based on our determination of your styling preferences and with our analysis of what would be the most attractive to your prefered partner gender which is listed as female. Is that correct Alexander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent you a customized workout and diet plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to attract the best mate, your true and eternal love, you must be as attractive as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must lose 12.9 kilograms while eating your prescribed diet, failure to do so is failure to love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Our analysis of the entirety of world literature, journals, diarys, medical records, and marriage records have determined that love is partially about sacrifice. Are you willing to sacrifice Alexander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander grabs his stomach. He does not consider himself unreasonably overweight and 12 kilograms seems like a large amount for his size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have sent you a few appointments. Please update your calendar accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Q, it is important to address people by their names, please practice by addressing me as Q. I am called Q because one of my developers thought it was clever to call me Q.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is. What are the appointments for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are the appointments for, Q?&rdquo; &ldquo;A haircut at 147 Victoria Street at 6:15 pm on Thursday, February 17th. I suggest you give me access to your calendar&rdquo;</p>

<p> A dialog box pops up on the phones screen and Alexander taps allow. His calendar fills with blocks of various colors. Red blocks say: Gym. Green: Reading Club. Blue: Work. Yellow list meals. Purple blocks: Art (Painting). Small orange blocks instruct him to Meditate. There is also pink ones that say: Massage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do I have to do all these things?...Q&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must work to pay bills and for a feeling of security. Gym and food makes you healthy and thus more desirable. Reading club is necessary because you need to learn to be a conversationalist and to be able to present with authority on important and emotional subjects. You already understand why meditation is necessary, as you practice it already. You must practice an art in order to express yourself. We determined painting to be your most useful form of self expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a lot of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your algorithm come up with that Q?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My machine learning code has determined that that phrase is to be of the most comfort to you&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I get massages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The massage parlor is for practicing sexual intercourse. You will pay them 500  dollars a session for one hour of intercourse. They sell sex at that location as well as massage and lotions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the sex will make you sad. Please continue taking your prescribed medication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander sighs to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Q?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are scheduled to be at the gym in thirty minutes, please situate yourself and prepare to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also, Alexander, as we have determined that you lean more toward gentlemanly behavior rather than roguish, please say &lsquo;Pardon me, Q&rsquo; or Excuse me, Q&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;what Q&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; Alexander says while trying to recall where his gym bag is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you Alexander, true love awaits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>Alexander had never felt more confident than he did now. He had spend the last seven weeks perpetually exhausted. It felt like he was back in university during exams drawn out for eternity. He was sore, hungry, tired but somehow optimistic for the night. Q had instructed him that he was ready to be in love. She instructed him to go to a bar called CandleStick etc. on Tuesday at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. When he asked why Q told him that CandleStick was the type of bar single women go to to meet guys. Q told him that true love like lightning could strike at any moment but, like lightning was more likely to be found in a storm. Q told him that CandleStick etc. at eight o&rsquo;clock on a Tuesday in his dark blue suit with a slim red tie was like holding a metal rod up in a lightning storm. Alexander agreed with Q as he always did and wondered if the lightning would finally kill him.</p>

<p>The bar is not particularly stormlike. Lit by soft amber lights, it is decorated in mostly dark wood furnishings. Liquor bottles are stacked in front of mirrored panels behind the bar from waist height to the ceiling which give the bar the illusion of being larger than it is as well as reflecting and distorting the lights through the bottles. There are a few patrons, but it does not seem overly busy. The crowd seems to be approaching thirty, the same as himself. The music, unintelligible indie rock, is played at a lower volume than the voices carried in casual conversation. </p>

<p>The distinct british woman cuts through the drone: &ldquo;Go to the far side of the bar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander walks past two men sitting next to each other who are not speaking. A group of four women whom he thinks are talking about the Mexican Riviera but can&rsquo;t be sure. As he sticks his foot up to climb the stool the voice speaks again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand like we practiced at cafes, do not sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmkay&rdquo; murmurs Alexander without opening his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order a drink&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What drink do I order, Q?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your favorite one.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Alexander&rsquo;s searching eyes meet the bartender who walks over. He is a taller more attractive man with shoulder tattoos that Alexander doesn&rsquo;t have time to make out. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a Ceaser please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How spicy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fair amount not too crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bartender leaves to make the drink. Alexander looks around the bar. There are two groups of three women each at tables in addition to the four talking about Mexico. A group of four men are talking the loudest each with beer bottles in front of them. There are the two silent guys near the entrance of the bar still staring ahead.</p>

<p>The bartender returns with the Ceaser. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sip and wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After three quarters of an hour of sipping and thinking, a group of three women walk into the bar. Alexander is quickly drawn to a ponytailed brunette and audibly announces &ldquo;Her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until they approach the bar to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello. Find the extrovert. Statistically there will be an extrovert. She will want to talk to you. Talk to her but look at the girl you want more than any, as she may be the extrovert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander&rsquo;s stance is open, he stands tall, his feet are consciously placed wider than his shoulders. He smirks slightly and waits for the brunette by pretending to scan the bar for an unarrived guest. His positioning is strategic: six feet from the queue. Close enough to interact with any ordering patron, but far enough to draw out a mate from the crowd. </p>

<p>The brunette is wearing a leather jacket and jeans with flat soled boots. She is a handful of inches shorter than him. He presumes she&rsquo;s in her mid-twenties, but his gauge for telling ages had been faulty for years. She has a confidence about her in the way she was emoting. The other women seem need her validation for their anecdotes and banter. </p>

<p>Alexander becomes self conscious of his gaze and looks at nowhere in particular across the bar. </p>

<p>The girls turn to order drinks. Alexander steels himself, all his preparation and training has led up to this. He cannot understand why, but Alexander has the deep sense that he was meant to be here. A strange feeling for a man who does not consider himself a believer in fate, Alexander feels the unfamiliar feeling of meeting destiny head-on. To hurried to dismiss his unreasonable emotion, Alexander looks directly into the eyes of his desire. She is looking directly into his.</p>

<p>Two powerful seconds pass and Alexander, despite the man he once was, he greets her: &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women gives him a smirking smile, takes a long stride forward and says: &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; in a cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Alexander looks down to remember his name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Alexander.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Serena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander looks back across the bar. </p>

<p>In his ear Q scoldes: &ldquo;Engage you f-...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the Alexander that introduces himself then looks away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I appear to be.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Alexander smiles bashfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ping-Pong. Tennis. Conversate you idiot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the Serena that is most beautiful?&ldquo;</p>

<p>She tilts the head and smiles: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink. Buy,&rdquo; Q says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink. Buy,&rdquo; Alexander says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink. Buy?...Yes, you can buy me a drink,&rdquo; Serena says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apologize to her for being a neanderthal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a neanderthal. I am sorry,&rdquo; Alexander says, then smiles at his absurdity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always wanted an neanderthal to buy me a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this neanderthal wants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serena turns her ear towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your number.&rdquo; </p>

<p>She laughs as Q insults him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neanderthals don&rsquo;t have phones, silly.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask what she is drinking, order two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Moscow Mule, don&rsquo;t let her mix it.&rdquo; She nods toward the bartender.</p>

<p>Alexander takes the brief moment of calmness in the line. The girl is beautiful. More intense than her beauty is how she looks at him, how her eyes pierce him. How weak he feels, and yet how strong. </p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; he whispers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learn about her, show her you care about her beyond her beauty. She likes you, it is really unbelievable. I am greatest thing to ever happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corny. Aside you don&rsquo;t know anything about her, have I not taught you any self respect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your unit appears to be faulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not helping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am helping immensely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander reaches the front of the lineup and orders two machine mixed moscow mules. The bartender rolls their eyes and asks: &ldquo;Best biofeedback rating?&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Alexander, and he briefly thinks about reducing the tip for the eyeroll, but decides not to in case the slightest amount of conflict or loathing could arise. Plus, he doesn&rsquo;t want to seem cheap.</p>

<p>While the bartender goes to the terminal Alexander looks back at Serena. She has her hand in front of her mouth and her brow looks slightly furrowed. She seems worried.</p>

<p>Just when Alexander is about done convincing himself that he upset her, the bartender returns with the drinks. </p>

<p>Alexander picks them up and steps back towards the girl. She looks up at him and grins an awfully nice grin. It is all Alexander ever wanted from a women.</p>

<p>As he sets the drinks down, Q whispers in his ear, &ldquo;Ask her what brought her to this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asks that and much more, Q interjecting less and less frequently as the couple down two more drinks. She is abrasive, consistently on the edge of banter into meanness. He desperately tries to stay above the line of self-confidence, like a poor swimmer in an unfriendly tide. They both depart with the other's number and a sense of connection.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite yet, darling.&rdquo; Q answers Alexander. </p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done an analysis of the first encounter and determined that you should contact her in two days at 7:19 AM.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to now. If it were up to me I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it is left up to you, you would be spending Friday night watching porn, eating cereal, and feeling sorry for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a great Friday to me. And by the way, I am a grown man, I do shit, asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do shit like swear at machines and exist alone and single and unhappy. The good news is: I am here to save you from yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not saving me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Alexander, friend, you can take me out at any moment. But you choose not to. You want me here. I am making your life better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s me though. I feel like I am cheating. I feel worse...like fake or- &rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel worse. You want to know how I determined that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have eaten more than one hotdog in your life. There is nothing in my database that can understand why any human would eat more than one hotdog.&rdquo;  Laughing Alexander resigns to keep his doubts to himself. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time you get all angsty, my dear, just do me favor and look in a mirror at that new body I motivated you to get. One day you will even get to share it with Serena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The new uptown restaurant is Q&rsquo;s suggestion. &lsquo;Judging things together is a bonding experience&rsquo; she told him in the date prep. The restaurant&rsquo;s walls are twelve foot high glass. The hostess asks him for his preference of human or waiterless ordering. Q instructed him to choose waiterless. The tables are touch-enabled-reflective-glass. Alexander had worked on a similar product in the past and was feeling jealous of the menu&rsquo;s UI, responsiveness, and flow. Too absorbed with the technology, he fails to see Serena walk in until she is halfway across the restaurant. She strides towards him with seemingly infinite self assuredness. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They exchange how-are-yous. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you choose this place?&rdquo; Serena asks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is new and I have passed it a few times and wondered what it is like.&rdquo; Alexander rehearses from Q&rsquo;s practice. It apparently shows a sense of adventure and a willingness to try new things which Q says is important not only in restaurant choice, but the bedroom as well. Alexander did not understand the connection. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Cool. This the non-human side I assume&rdquo; she says as she scrolls through the menu. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why anyone would want human service nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Social interaction or whatever.&rdquo; Alexander replies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fake social interaction.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Most is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair point. Fuck me,&rdquo; she says and then twitches her head to the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change subject. Favorite restaurant,&rdquo; whispers Q.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your favorite place to eat?&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay...don&rsquo;t judge me. Or do, you&rsquo;re gonna fucking judge me so do it,&rdquo; Serena blurts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; Alexander replies enthusiastically to ease her apparent discomfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, so, there is this underground place downtown. Not even really a real restaurant. Not even on the internet, well, probably on the internet, but like it doesn&rsquo;t have a official site or whatever.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Serena searches Alexander's facial expression for signs of comfort and affection. He gives her more than enough for her to continue, so she keeps talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this fucking crazy place, like human chefs and waiters and the menu has like banned shit on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Banned shit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah like Veal and foie gras. I get the veal, it&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s like in a back alley and shit&#8230; Listen you don&rsquo;t think I am a bad person for liking veal?&rdquo; </p>

<p>Alexander could see a hint of worry in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d try it,&rdquo; Alexander replies. </p>

<p>Q chimes in. &ldquo;Get her a drink. A Moscow Mule. It shows you remember.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Alexander orders two from the glass table. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you single?&rdquo; Serena asks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8230; I have bad luck with girls or&#8230; they don&rsquo;t like me&#8230;&rdquo; Alexander struggles to not seem pathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute. I like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. How about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d better think I am cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, why are you single? Being so beautiful and charismatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awe.. well I... I can&rsquo;t find good guys, you know? Half of them are the fake nice until you disagree with me type, half are jerks who treat me like shit, and the other half hate me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s three halves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm down Alexander that wasn't a mathematical proof of why guys hate me. Plus, you never really gave me an answer, I don&rsquo;t care though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8230;&rdquo; Alexander could tell that she was searching for an excuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever. What do you want to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Veal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the opening Alexander, have an adventure.&rdquo; says Q.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; says Alexander. &ldquo;Yes, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let's go to the sketchy restaurant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay one more drink and then lets go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair go to the nearest bus stop with their arms locked together. They both feel comfortable with each other and board the bus for downtown. The bus route takes a path along a vista which illuminates the city beneath them. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I think the lights of the city can replace the lights of the stars.&rdquo; Serena says.</p>

<p>Alexander looks up into the evening sky. The lights and the pollution have turned the sky into a dark unmarked blanket with a slight yellow hue. There is nothing up there for him: no constellations, no moon, no spec of nuclear light a millenia away. Just the dull amber glow of the city&rsquo;s light reflecting off of the exhaust of this section of humanity. </p>

<p>However, below, the city lights are bright and each node distinguishable. Manufactured and pumped with electrons; they glow brighter than any star above. From a distance, they seem magical, but like the streetlights overhead, up close they are hard and uniform and utterly mechanical. Alexander does not consider the lights nearby, and he wishes on a far away lamppost. He wishes that this date will be last forever. </p>

<p>Q commands: &ldquo;Kiss her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander swallows hard. He leans in and Serena&rsquo;s lips meet with his. The gentle warmness sends shivers up his spine. They part for a second and look into each other's eyes. She glances back down at his lips and he presses forward again. Within, Alexander is bursting with electricity, he has never experienced anything like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long enough.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Alexander obeys and the couple dive back into easy conversation.</p>

<p>The bus arrives at the stop downtown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Serena gestures down 8th street. The sidewalks are busy with a range of people from synthetic drug users leaning on the sides of buildings to college age kids standing in circles smoking and chatting. Sounds from the street side restaurants and dive-bars mesh with the hum of cars and voices. Alexander walks with his hand in his pocket while Serena wraps hers between his body and arm. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Posture.&rdquo; Q snaps when Alexander begins staring at the ground looking for bits of useable conversation. Serena shares a story about being left on a sidewalk on this street by an ex-friend one drunken night. Alexander imagines Serena's friends and immediately worries about them liking him. </p>

<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Serena pushes Alexander down an ally carefully stepping around trash and the occasional needle. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the perfect location.&rdquo; Serena chides: &ldquo;any cop is likely to run into an OD-ing addict before they reach the door.&ldquo; </p>

<p>Serena quickly apologizes: &ldquo;I am sorry. I am a bit too vulgar at times. I put people off, I will probably put you off.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t&rdquo; </p>

<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A conspicuously dressed man leans on the threshold of an open door. He has a wool sport-jacket with patches on the elbows and a crisp shirt. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi Mac. Table for two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, m&rsquo;dear.&rdquo; he answers in an affected accent. </p>

<p>The inside of the place is chaotic, the walls are shelved floor to ceiling with old things. There are boxy displays with old-school games on them. Plastic figurines, record collections, small army men in an infinite battle in individual square sections of shelving. </p>

<p>Mac seats them at a table next to an array of porcelain figures. Mac is followed quickly by a French-Canadian waiter. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I get you drinks to start?&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Veeeeal.&rdquo; Serena trumpets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seconded, oh and two moscow-mu&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rye-Whiskey.&rdquo; interjects Serena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moscow-mule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I instruct you to do that?&rdquo; Q says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; says Alexander aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No moscow mule?&rdquo; the waiter balks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, yes a moscow mule.&rdquo; Alexander stumbles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about an moscow ass?&rdquo; the waiter waits dully staring at Alexander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No...moscow mule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eeediot&rdquo; the waiter slurs as he turns on his heel towards an unseen section of the restaurant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the waiter just call me an idiot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, this place is the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Q whispers: &ldquo;Repeat after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey do you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey do you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That when the waiter was asking if we wanted a moscow ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That when the waiter was asking if we wanted a moscow ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was offering us Russian prostitutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander chuckles &ldquo;....He was offering us Russian prostitutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serena slumps down laughing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh these.&rdquo; She springs up and grabs a pink porcelain pig out off a lineup which is leading into a plastic castle with an old book called Slaughterhouse-Five stuck over the entrance. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piggy bank, Alexander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember coins? Yeah, people used to put coins in these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because people are stupid and compulsive. I love these. Oh...this is a good one. You see there is no hole at the bottom to get the coins out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to smash it with a fucking hammer. It&rsquo;s so cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter returns with the drink, &ldquo;Mule for the ass and whiskey for the adult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander says cooly:&rdquo;Can I buy this pig&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you think you are young man?&rdquo; Q says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Because you wanna statue of yourself, or because the hole is the size of your cock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serena laughs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not helping you with this.&rdquo; Q says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...how much?&rdquo; Alexander asks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three-hundred&rdquo; </p>

<p>Sensing that the price is unreasonable and to not seem like a pushover in front of his girl Alexander bargains: &ldquo;One-fifty&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fuck you! Two hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander takes the small victory and presents the pig to Serena who is holding her hands over her mouth. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You are great. You are doing great you know?&rdquo; Serena announces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got ripped off you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you smiled so it was worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The couple joyfully flirt until the waiter returns. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Two veal cutlets for the garbage pickers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meat is tender and smooth. The taste fully negates the sense of guilt. They leave satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live within walking distance.&rdquo; Serena says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invite yourself over coward.&rdquo; Q taunts.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the meat in his stomach, the alcohol, and the small victory Alexander takes a risk: &ldquo;Can I come over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I like you, heehee&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you, too&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have you know that I don&rsquo;t have sex on the first date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Alexander agrees. He is happy enough to spend more time with her, sex with Serena still seems like a far and wild fantasy. </p>

<p>Serena lives on the fourth floor of a middle-class apartment building. She set the pig on the coffee table and rubs it before asking if he wants a drink. Alexander accepts and sits on the couch.</p>

<p>After using the bathroom Serena brings him his drink and sits next to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know this really was a wonderful date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; Alexander agrees staring into her pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss her.&rdquo; Q commands.</p>

<p>The two kiss. At first slow, Alexander reaching for the exposed skin. Then faster and with small amounts of tongue. He kisses her soft cheek and her neck and makes his way to her ear when he sees the light catch something faint. In her ear canal is the familiar webbing of the Cupidious earpiece. </p>

<p>He freezes. The two seconds of silence is soul crushing. They both feel an acute sense of shame and dread. Alexander tries to kiss her again, but she pulls away. He can see the machination of her mind written on her face. </p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know what it is?&rdquo; she whimpers.</p>

<p>Two more agonizing seconds pass. Lies do not come to his mind. He is naked in his defeat. Alexander shamefully turns his head towards her. She already knows what will be inside but a glimpse of it sends her down into a slump. She holds her hands over her eyes and mutters: &ldquo;We are both terrible.&rdquo; </p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p> Twenty-years later</p>

<p>Alexander arrives at his apartment after working late. A neatly wrapped package sits on the doorstep. Alexander picks it up and carries it inside. He sets it on the counter and reads the tag: [To my lovely Serena Love Alexander.] </p>

<p>&ldquo;Q what is that?&rdquo; Alexander asks as he walks to the window. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your 20th anniversary tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. What is it?&rdquo; Alexander asks as he looks at the sea of lights. </p>

<p>&ldquo;A piggy bank, Alexander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander looks up into the matte sky.</p>
