				<div class="storyBody"><p>Alexander rereads the text message from Tris: &ldquo;I had a nice time too. You&rsquo;re really cute and fun to talk to. I&rsquo;m just not sure if we had the connection I was looking for. So I don&rsquo;t know if dinner would be the best idea. I honestly wish you all the best&rdquo;. He reruns the date in his mind over and over. Had he texted her too soon? Had he misread her? Why did she give him her phone number after the date if she wasn&rsquo;t into him? Did she decide later she didn&rsquo;t like him? Was it because he hugged her and she wanted a kiss? <br />
				 Alexander opens an incognito tab and types the address of a porn site into his browser. He hovers his mouse over slideshows of writhing and contorted bodies. He settles on a tall pale blonde girl partly because he recognizes her from previous sessions, but mostly because Tris is short and brunette. He is not able finish and stops when he feels an acute sense of shame which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and insecurity. It had been a good date. His failure to get a follow up dents his already underwhelming confidence, a trait which he knows is critical to making a woman desire a man.</p>

				<p> He scrolls through his Instagram and SocialLife feeds looking at updates, shared articles, and memes of his old acquaintances. An old co-worker&rsquo;s toddler&rsquo;s birthday party scrolls across the screen. He feels bad for the child, knowing her mother to be irresponsible and her father to be an idiot. His good friend&rsquo;s wife is sharing a recipe for health conscious pretzels which makes him slightly jealous but principally filled with a vicarious sense of happiness. He knows they married young due to an unplanned child. He knows the struggle they overcame to be able to make those gluten-free, dairy-free, and taste-free pretzels. He opens a new tab for the dating app he frequents so he can make another attempt at the type of life that brings homemade health conscious tasteless pretzels. </p>

				<p> He searches the name of the app into his engine. Scrolling down the page he sees the familiarly formatted text and picture boxes. He moves his mouse to the sites link and, though usually unfazed by the advertising which permeated everyone&rsquo;s life, sees something appealing. Above the link to the site was a box that read: &ldquo;Solve dating troubles with Cupidious. An A.I. solution to dating difficulties.&rdquo; Alexander shakes his head and returns to the dating site. </p>

				<p> Pictures of women of all types glow on his screen. There are women with animated and classically styled tattoos. Tall girls, short girls, girls with naturally colored hair and girls with extreme fluorescent dye jobs. He unironically considers them and their written bios if he were even slightly attracted to them. He imagines their first date and where he would try to take them. He thinks about what styles of music he'd play them. What would he be wearing, and what would she be wearing? All these realities and more cross his mind as well as the negative ones. The ones where they chew him up and spit him out. Use him for money or a free meal or to get back at an ex. Or worse, like Tris, give him false hope that something more will come but never does. Alexander closes the browser and pulls his pants back up from around his knees.</p>

				<p> In the kitchen, Alexander chooses the Epicurean Desires menu from his counter&rsquo;s terminal and enters chicken cordon bleu. The counter hums gently as he fills a glass of water. He walks across his apartment floor made of repurposed leather belts arranged in a cross hatch pattern. The apartment is sparsely decorated with floor-to-ceiling one way glass windows that overlook the downtown area of the small city. Alexander sits on the foot of his queen sized foam mattress and meditates.</p>

				<p> A harmonic beep from the kitchen frees the man from his attempt at meditation. He opens the drawer on his glass topped bedside table and he takes out two bottles of prescription medication. He swallows one of each and walks back across the leather floor to the engineered plate of food from the serving station located precisely in the middle of the counter.</p>

				<p> The chicken is as delicious as any he has had before. The original recipe is sourced from Nice, France, and has been improved by 750,000 reiterations of machine learning trails matched to Filipino and Ukrainian biofeedbackers. Alexander eats his glorious meal alone. </p>

				<p> He places the used dish back on the presentation tray and takes two steps towards his desk. He considers the value of his idea and turns compulsively back to the counters terminal. &ldquo;Health Pretzel&rdquo; is entered into the search bar and several recipes light up indicating that he has the ingredients. Naturally he chooses the highest taste rated and starts the apparatus. Alexander walks back to his computer to imagine more lives. </p>

				<p> He sits in front of his screen back to selecting the proper porn thumbnail to watch while he eats the warm pretzel with his left hand. He concludes the pretzel must be thoroughly more satiating than that which his friend&rsquo;s spouse made. <br />
				After finishing to a video of a french girl and two guys, Alexander returns to the search screen and enters the dating apps title. Again, before clicking through to the site he stops on the ad: &ldquo;Cupidious. An A.I. solution to dating difficulties&rdquo;. More intrigued by the technology than the women, he returns to the search bar and enters: &ldquo;Cupidious review.&rdquo; Alex reactively clicks the top result and it takes him to a listicle titled &ldquo;Dating with A.I.: Reviews and ranking of dating A.I. systems&rdquo;. There are four entries to the list. </p>

				<p> 3. HookLineAndWinHer: The original machine learning wingman application HookLineAndWinHer uses its years of entries to examine dating profiles from a wide variety of sites to allow the man to send the best flirtatious messages to get those girls on dates. However, that is as far as the application goes, unlike other entries on our list HookLineAndWinHer, and it will not actually help you be the interesting or dynamic person that the messages communicate. This, as well as its barring non-lesbian female users is why it is derided by the gentler gender. When this app was first introduced it was incredibly common for women to deride the &ldquo;Hookers&rdquo; they met dating online that failed to meet expectations.</p>

				<p> 2. WingBot: WingBot is the handy and mostly harmless wingman app which you could ask advice from while your date was in the bathroom or otherwise occupied. The premium version of this app has an always listening version while the free version requires manual text entry for your escapades. WingBot has a large database full of conversation starters, jokes, and specialized dating ideas. The disadvantage to this system is that in order to get the most power out of it, the user is required to be especially studious and mindful to update the app with new data about your date&rsquo;s thoughts, likes, dislikes, and flirtatious signals which many of those who need to use an A.I. for dating are unaware of.</p>

				<p> 1. Cupidious: This new venture is a very powerful and involved A.I. (and very expensive). Cupidious is with you every step of the way from the initial messages to its procedurally generated jewelry camera and Samsung inner ear webbing which gives specific and detailed instructions to the user from audio and video. Cupidious is very powerful: you will get laid, you will have great dates, you will get out of the rut. However, Cupidious is so powerful you may never want to turn it off. More than one reviewer have suffered serious mental health consequences from this A. I. and all users are required to pass an application with the company in order to qualify as well as sign an indemnification clause with the Cupidious corporation so they avoid liability. </p>

				<p> Alexander rereads the text message from Tris again. He deletes the message and the contact information and then reaches for his wallet.</p>

				<p> . . .</p>

				<p> Alexander arrives at his apartment complex after nine hours of work as a software architect. His mailbox glows but he already knows the package has arrived from incessant tracking on his phone. He rushes up eight stories of stairs that he chooses to climb every time he gets home from work. At his apartment his heart rate is doubly elevated. The package opens easily. </p>

				<p> On top is a booklet with a silhouette of a cherub that looks like it could be a gym or high school team logo. Alexander holds his phone over the booklet to auto play the instructions on his phone. </p>

				<p> Place the Samsung inner ear webbing into your ear. </p>

				<p> Alexander follows the instruction. </p>

				<p> Choose a voice.</p>

				<p> Alexander chooses female. A voice with a soothing but stern English accent says: &ldquo;Hello Alexander, I am Q, I will be your guide to eternal love. Please place the bracelet on your left wrist.&rdquo; Alexander begins to put on a grey and blue bracelet with a obsidian clasp.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;The bracelet was chosen for you based on our determination of your styling preferences and with our analysis of what would be the most attractive to your prefered partner gender which is listed as female. Is that correct Alexander?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>&ldquo;I have sent you a customized workout and diet plan.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;In order to attract the best mate, your true and eternal love, you must be as attractive as possible.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You must lose 12.9 kilograms while eating your prescribed diet, failure to do so is failure to love.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Our analysis of the entirety of world literature, journals, diarys, medical records, and marriage records have determined that love is partially about sacrifice. Are you willing to sacrifice Alexander?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Alexander grabs his stomach. He does not consider himself unreasonably overweight and 12 kilograms seems like a large amount for his size.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We have sent you a few appointments. Please update your calendar accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;My name is Q, it is important to address people by their names, please practice by addressing me as Q. I am called Q because one of my developers thought it was cleaver to call me Q.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It is. What are the appointments for?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&#8230;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What are the appointments for, Q?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;A haircut at 147 Victoria Street at 6:15 pm on Thursday, February 17th. I suggest you give me access to your calendar&rdquo;</p>

				<p> A dialog box pops up on the phones screen and Alexander taps allow. His calendar fills with blocks of various colors. Red blocks say: Gym. Green: Reading Club. Blue: Work. Yellow list meals. Purple blocks: Art (Painting). Small orange blocks instruct him to Meditate. There is also pink ones that say: Massage.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Why do I have to do all these things?...Q&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You must work to pay bills and for a feeling of security. Gym and food makes you healthy and thus more desirable. Reading club is necessary because you need to learn to be a conversationalist and to be able to present with authority on important and emotional subjects. You already understand why meditation is necessary, as you practice it already. You must practice an art in order to express yourself. We determined painting to be your most useful form of self expression.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That is a lot of work.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Life is suffering.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Did your algorithm come up with that Q?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;My machine learning code has determined that that phrase is to be of the most comfort to you&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;At least I get massages.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Sex.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;The massage parlor is for practicing sexual intercourse. You will pay them 500 dollars a session for one hour of intercourse. They sell sex at that location as well as massage and lotions.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better I guess.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;No, the sex will make you sad. Please continue taking your prescribed medication.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Alexander sighs to himself.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Alexander.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What Q?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You are scheduled to be at the gym in thirty minutes, please situate yourself and prepare to leave.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;...Okay.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Also, Alexander, as we have determined that you lean more toward gentlemanly behavior rather than roguish, please say &lsquo;Pardon me, Q&rsquo; or Excuse me, Q&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;what Q&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; Alexander says while trying to recall where his gym bag is.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Thank you Alexander, true love awaits.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>. . .</p>

				<p> Alexander had never felt more confident than he did now. He had spend the last seven weeks perpetually exhausted. It felt like he was back in university during exams drawn out for eternity. He was sore, hungry, tired but somehow optimistic for the night. Q had instructed him that he was ready to be in love. She instructed him to go to a bar called CandleStick etc. on Tuesday at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. When he asked why Q told him that CandleStick was the type of bar single women go to to meet guys. Q told him that true love like lightning could strike at any moment but, like lightning was more likely to be found in a storm. Q told him that CandleStick etc. at eight o&rsquo;clock on a Tuesday in his dark blue suit with a slim red tie was like holding a metal rod up in a lightning storm. Alexander agreed with Q as he always did and wondered if the lightning would finally kill him.</p>

				<p> The bar is not particularly stormlike. Lit by soft amber lights, it is decorated in mostly dark wood furnishings. Liquor bottles are stacked in front of mirrored panels behind the bar from waist height to the ceiling which give the bar the illusion of being larger than it is as well as reflecting and distorting the lights through the bottles. There are a few patrons, but it does not seem overly busy. The crowd seems to be approaching middle age, the same as himself. The music, unintelligible indie rock, is played at a lower volume than the voices carried in casual conversation. </p>

				<p> The distinct british woman cuts through the drone: &ldquo;Go to the far side of the bar.&rdquo;</p>

				<p> Alexander walks past two men sitting next to each other who are not speaking. A group of four women whom he thinks are talking about the Mexican Riviera but can&rsquo;t be sure. As he sticks his foot up to climb the stool the voice speaks again.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Stand like we practiced at cafes, do not sit.&rdquo;<br />
				&ldquo;Mmmkay&rdquo; murmured Alexander without opening his mouth.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Order a drink&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What drink do I order, Q?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Your favorite one.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Alexander&rsquo;s searching eyes meet the bartender who walks over. He is a taller more attractive man with shoulder tattoos that Alexander doesn&rsquo;t have time to make out. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Can I have a Ceaser please?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;How spicy?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;A fair amount not too crazy.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The bartender leaves to make the drink. Alexander looks around the bar. There are two groups of three women each at tables in addition to the four talking about Mexico. A group of four men are talking the loudest each with beer bottles in front of them. There are the two silent guys near the entrance of the bar still staring ahead.</p>

				<p>The bartender returns with the Ceaser. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Sip and wait.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>After three quarters of an hour of sipping and thinking, a group of three women walk into the bar. Alexander is quickly drawn to a ponytailed brunette and audibly announces &ldquo;Her.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Wait until they approach the bar to talk.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What do I say?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Hello. Find the extrovert. Statistically there will be an extrovert she will want to talk to you. Talk to her but look at the girl you want more than any, she may be the extrovert.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;<br />
