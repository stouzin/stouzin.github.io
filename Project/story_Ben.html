<p>The lake shivered as a wind blew across it. Trevor watched the ripples on the water, like a shadow of the wind, make their way towards the boat. He braced himself as they reached the boat and the wind bit into the exposed skin on his face. It reached for his body as well but was deflected away by the heavy jacket he wore. Tears formed in the corners of his eyes as he squinted in response to the chill.</p>
<p>He sniffed and wiped away the water droplets that had formed at the tip of his nose with the back of his glove. He gave the fishing rod he was holding a small jiggle. This would accomplish nothing, but a significant amount of fishing seemed to revolve around accomplishing nothing.</p>
<p>Staring out over the lake, a peacefulness stole across his thoughts, and he wondered why he didn't come here more often. There was something about the lake that allowed him to forget the stresses of real life. Maybe it was the silence. The silence that wasn’t real silence. It was silence pregnant with noise -- birds singing, fish jumping, insects chirping, waves lapping against the boat – it was never really silent. Yet, it seemed like there was no noise at all, and Trevor could be at peace with his thoughts.</p>
<p>Twenty yards out a fish jumped out of the water and fell back with a splash. Behind him, Trevor felt Andy shift to look at the occurrence.</p>
<p>“You see that?” Trevor asked.</p>

<p>“Nope, but I heard it,” replied Andy, his voice raspy from lack of use. These were the first words the pair had said to each other in the past hour. Each man had been lost in their thoughts, content to sit and fish as though the other didn’t exist.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection2">
<p>Trevor shifted around on the pillow he was sitting on, trying to get his blood flowing again. “They’re gonna start biting soon.” He gave his rod another jiggle, just in case a trout was staring at his lure at that very moment.</p>
<p>“Nah, too early yet. Sun ain’t high enough.”</p>

<p>Trevor looked up at the overcast sky and frowned. “What sun?” he asked. “The only sun there is.”</p>
<p>“That sun is hid behind clouds, my unfunny friend.”</p>

<p>"The fish don't know that. To them, the sun is either up or not up. Clouds are irrelevant," Andy declared like it was in the Bible.</p>
<p>Trevor wasn’t about to let that statement go without a challenge. “And how the hell would you know that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I just do.” "Well, I don't believe you."</p>
<p>“Well, that’s probably why I catch more fish than you. Year after year after year, I haul ‘em in, and you get skunked."</p>
<p>Trevor could hear Andy’s smug smile. “You know what your problem is Andy?” he asked, tucking his rod between his knees so he could rub his hands together to warm them up.</p>
<p>“What’s that now?”</p>

<p>“You’re constantly living in the past,” Trevor said, grabbing the rod and giving it another jiggle. It continued to not catch fish in response.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop living in the past when it stops repeating itself.”</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection3">
<p>Trevor pondered his friend’s mildly philosophical statement as he reached under the seat and dragged the cooler out from under it. It tugged at a memory, but the memory slipped away before he could snag it.</p>
<p>“Grab me one while you’re in there, would ya?” Andy asked.</p>

<p>Trevor opened the cooler and reached into the mix of ice and water until his hand hit a can of Coors. He pulled it out, cracked it and handed it to his friend. “Thanks bud,” Andy said as he took it.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Trevor replied as he pulled out a can for himself and cracked it. The beer was shockingly cold as it slid down his throat. He could barely taste it, the familiar bitterness hidden behind the numbing sensation. He closed the cooler lid and pushed it back beneath the seat. A pebble must have gotten caught underneath it because it screeched as he slid it across the bottom of the aluminum boat.</p>
<p>He winced at the noise and admonition he knew was coming.</p>

<p>“Shhhhhhhhhhh! You’ll scare the fish.” It had probably been said in fishing boats back when they were a new invention.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Trevor fired back. “I thought you said they weren’t interested, sun wasn’t doin’ whatever it does to make the fish hungry or something.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter what the sun is doing, there is no reason to stomp your feet and scream and holler and alert every living thing within twenty miles to the fact that we’re here,” Andy scolded.</p>
<p>Ten yards away, another fish jumped out of the water.</p>

<p>For fifteen seconds, there was dead silence between the pair.</p>

<p>“You were saying,” Trevor said, a smug smile of his own strutting onto his face.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection4">
<p>“I was saying you should be quiet because the fish are about to start biting,” Andy replied.</p>
<p>Trevor chuckled at the comment and took another sip of beer.</p>

<p>Another comfortable silence descended on the boat, the pair occasionally sipping their beers and jiggling their lines, staring into the distance and into their thoughts.</p>
<p>Not far from the boat, a loon surfaced in sudden silence. It was close enough that Trevor could see the pupils of its beady red eyes. It looked directly at Trevor for a moment and then dove back under the surface of the lake, just a silently as it had appeared.</p>
<p>The memory stirred in Trevor’s mind again and this time he grabbed it before it could disappear. The memory came with feelings that rose up out of the shadows of his mind. His sense of peace disappeared, engulfed by the darkness attached to the memory. “Hey Andy, you remember that time we found that nest?” He glanced over his shoulder at his friend and saw him cock his head like he was trying to recall what Trevor was talking about.</p>
<p>“No man, I don’t remember any nest.”</p>

<p>“Sure you do. It was at this lake. We were kids, like nine or ten probably,” Trevor prompted.</p>
<p>“Not ringing any bells champ, sorry.”</p>

<p>Trevor took another sip of his beer as his mind drifted back through the decades.</p>

<p>Trevor and Andy had known each other forever. Their parents were good friends, and they used to do joint family holidays at Long Gone lake. It was located far from the beaten path, requiring at least three hours of travel down logging roads to reach it. Tough to get to, but worth it. The seclusion was total. Never saw another camper.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection5">
<p>Long Gone had a real name, but Trevor didn’t know what it was. His father might have known. Trevor had meant to ask him, but he had never gotten around to it, and his father had died five years previous. Heart attack took him in his sleep. Trevor had asked his mother a few years after his father's death while visiting her at her condo, but she told him that they had always just called it Long Gone. So, to him, it was Long Gone. Truth be told, Trevor kind of liked it that way. Made it seem like it was beyond the reach of society.</p>
<p>Every year, the families would go to the lake right around midsummer. They had it down to a science -- just as the summer heat reached its peak, the families would pack up, flee the city and find relief in their secluded mountain oasis. The lake water was frigid eleven months out of the year. That twelfth month though, the water was perfect swimming temperature. It was in the shallows of this lake that Trevor had learned to swim.</p>
<p>There were four kids. Trevor and his sister, Melony, and Andy and his sister, Trish. The girls were both a year older than their brothers and were best friends before high school. They drifted apart once they hit high school, circumstances leading them down different paths. When Trevor was fifteen, Trish would be his first kiss and then quickly his first rejection when he tried to ask her on a date.</p>
<p>At this time though, back when the boys were nine and the girls were ten, the girls didn’t like playing with the boys for very long. They would play together for a bit before splitting into two groups and making their own fun, having their own adventures. Andy and Trevor would head off and explore around the lake. There were paths leading through the pine forest surrounding the lake and the pair had explored them for hours, summer after summer, until they knew them like the backs of their hands.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection6">
<p>That particular day, they had been exploring the west shore of the lake. It was mid- afternoon, and the mountain peak that loomed over the lake was blocking the scorching afternoon sun. The air was chilly in that magic way that mountain air can be when not in direct sunlight, able to make dense heat vanish in the lightest shade.</p>
<p>They were using the walk to discuss one of their favourite and most divisive topics. “I like tigers,” Andy said.</p>
<p>Trevor shook his head causing his hair to fall into his eyes. “Tigers are alright, but falcons are better,” he countered as he brushed the dark brown, almost black hair out of his eyes.</p>
<p>Andy shook his head more vigorously and ran into the same problem with his hair. “No, they’re not! Tigers eat falcons all the time,” he cried, pushing his blond locks back.</p>
<p>“No, they don’t!”</p>

<p>It was a stalemate that required Andy to draw on the deepest depths of his zoological knowledge to break. "Yes, they do. Cats eat birds." Checkmate.</p>
<p>It was a near perfect argument, but Trevor wasn’t going to go down without a fight. “Only stupid, slow birds. Falcons are the fastest animals on the planet. No way a tiger could catch a falcon.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. They are pretty fast,” Andy conceded. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>They walked in silence for a while, thinking deep thoughts about tigers fighting falcons.</p>

<p>They were dressed in basically the same get up, cut-off jean shorts paired with cut-off tees, which exposed a pair of impressive farmer tans. Andy was a little taller and was fair where Trevor was dark. By this point in the summer, the boys had spent enough time outside to have</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection7">
<p>cultivated deep tans. Andy’s had a nice golden hue, with freckles dotting across his nose and down his arms while Trevor was a solid nut-brown.</p>
<p>Andy saw the nest first. He had sharp eyes. It was tucked into the shore of the lake, hidden by a bunch of reeds. When they got closer, Trevor could see that it was made up of the same kind of reeds, which gave the nest incredible camouflage.</p>
<p>“How the hell’d you see it?” Trevor asked, brushing aside the thicket to get a better look. He only said hell when it was him and Andy. His parents would have had a fit if they heard him say it. Might even tan his ass. But he liked saying it. Made him feel like a criminal or something.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you missed it. It’s sitting here, plain as day,” Andy replied, crouching down to inspect it.</p>
<p>It was bigger than any nest Trevor had ever seen up close, about as wide around as a basketball. It sat on the ground in the boggy mud that made up the shore on this side of the lake. The whole place stank. It reminded Trevor of rotten eggs. At the bottom of the nest sat two little eggs. They were almost the exact colour of the mud, with little bluish speckles dotted across their surface.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of bird they are,” Trevor said.</p>

<p>Andy scratched his head and leaned in a little closer. “Loons,” he said, after a moment’s contemplation.</p>
<p>“How d’you know?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t a secret. Loons have brown eggs with blue spots,” Andy replied with a confidence that only young boys who are completely full of shit can convey.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Trevor said, suitably impressed.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection8">
<p>They stared at the eggs in silence for a few minutes. Trevor marvelled at the intricacy of the nest. Must have taken the loons forever to build it, them having no hands and all.</p>
<p>Andy looked over at him. There was a look in his eye that Trevor had seen before and it always made him uneasy. “I dare you to smash ‘em,” Andy said, nodding at the eggs.</p>
<p>Trevor frowned in disgust. “No.” He really didn’t like when Andy got like this and it had been happening a lot lately.</p>
<p>“You have to, I dared you.”</p>

<p>Trevor wasn’t sure what to do. He knew that Andy wasn’t going to let it go. If Trevor didn’t do it, he was going to hear about it all day and probably all week. But he didn’t want to do it. The thought of it made his stomach feel funny.</p>
<p>Andy just stared at him. He had dark blue eyes, and they gave his stare weight. It felt like Trevor was being crushed beneath the expectation of his friend. Andy seemed to enjoy his distress. He had a small smile on his face. It didn’t make him look friendly at all. He looked right into Trevor’s eyes. “Do it.” It was a command.</p>
<p>“Fine, whatever. I don’t even care.” Trevor stood up and raised his foot over the eggs. He hesitated. The poor loon parents put so much work into the nest.</p>
<p>“Do it,” Andy said from somewhere behind him.</p>

<p>They were going to come back and see their nest broken and eggs smashed. “Do it!”</p>
<p>They’d be sad.</p>

<p>Trevor shook his head. He couldn’t do it. He didn’t care if Andy teased him for the rest of the trip. It was a bad thing to do. He made to turn around and felt a hand shove him from behind. Reflexively, he brought his foot down to steady himself.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection9">
<p>There was a sickening crunch as his foot landed.</p>

<p>Trevor pulled his foot up from the wreckage of the nest. The goop from the inside of the eggs was stuck to his foot.</p>
<p>He gagged.</p>

<p>Thoughts raced through his mind. He hadn’t meant to do it. He didn’t want the birds to be sad. He was going to get in trouble. It had sounded so gross. It had felt even worse.</p>
<p>He gagged again. Tears rolled down his cheeks. He turned around.</p>

<p>Andy was lying on the ground, hands on his stomach because he was laughing so hard. He looked over at Trevor and laughed even harder. “You should see your face right now!” he said, gasping between laughs.</p>
<p>Watching Andy roll around in the dirt, laughing at the horrible thing he’d just made Trevor do made Trevor angrier than he knew he could get. He could barely hear past the blood pounding in his ears, and his breath was coming in heaves and gasps</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?” Trevor demanded, streams of rage and shame coiling through his mind. His face was flushed beneath the tears rolling down it. Hands balled into tiny fists, he shook as he stared at his friend.</p>
<p>Andy stifled his laughter enough so that he could sit up. “Because I could see you were going to wuss out,” he said, brushing the dirt off his shorts. He stood up, walked over to the nest and kneeled down to get a good look. “That was awesome. Did you hear that friggen crunch?”</p>
<p>The memory of the sound ripped through Trevor’s mind. He felt the rage drain away as his stomach flipped again. He unclenched his hands and wiped away the tears. “I’m going back to camp.” He didn’t wait on Andy’s reply, he just started walking.</p>
<p>After a second, he heard Andy jogging to catch up with him.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection10">
<p>“What’s your problem?” Andy asked, as he came even with Trevor on the path. “I don’t have a problem.”</p>
<p>“You’re being a baby.” “No, I’m not.”</p>
<p>“You better not go crying to your mom,” Andy warned.</p>

<p>“I am not going to cry or tell my mom,” Trevor snapped. “Just shut up, ok?” “Jeez. Sorry,” Andy said, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>They went back to camp and neither of them said anything about the eggs to their parents. They never talked about it again, but Trevor heard the crunch of the impact in his dreams for years.</p>

<p>The memory faded. Trevor looked down at the beer in his hand. He had squeezed the can, crumpling it slightly. Even now, decades later, the memory made him feel angry. “Hey,” he said, getting Andy’s attention.</p>
<p>“What’sup?”</p>

<p>“Why’d you make me smash those eggs?” “What eggs?”</p>
<p>“Those loon eggs, back when we were kids.”</p>

<p>“Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Like how young we talkin’ here?” “I don’t know Andy, like nine or ten probably. It was here at this lake, on one of the</p>
<p>summer trips.”</p>

<p>“That’s a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t mean you can’t remember.”</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection11">
<p>“I guess. What exactly happened?”</p>

<p>Trevor paused and looked out over the lake. He was searching for perspective, looking for the part of the shore that had held the nest, but so much had changed. The lake was the same. He wasn’t. It is so hard, as an adult, trying to see things as you did when you were a child. He shook his head and took another sip of his beer. It had gone flat. “We were walking around the lake, I think on the north-east corner somewhere, and we found a loon nest with a couple of eggs in it. You dared me to smash them, which was messed up enough, but when I said I wouldn’t do it, you shoved me so that I stepped on the eggs anyways.” He waited for a response but there was only silence. “You remember?”</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Andy said. He sounded distant, Trevor could picture him, brow furrowed, squinting into the past as he tried to recover the memory as Trevor just had.</p>
<p>It had been a long time ago, and Trevor knew that a lot of life had happened between then and now. Trevor hadn't even thought about it in years. More important things had happened to them both.</p>
<p>“Either way,” Andy said, “I’m sorry I did it. That was a messed up time. My parents had just started fighting hard around then. It got a lot worse over the next few years, you know that, but that was right around when it started.”</p>
<p>Trevor shook his head. “I didn’t know that.” They didn’t talk about Andy’s parent’s divorce too often.</p>
<p>“Yeah man. So, I’m not surprised. I remember what I was like back then. I remember feeling confused all the time. And angry, I wanted things to hurt. It was scary, just having those kinds of thoughts pop into my head out of nowhere. And...”</p>
<p>“And what?”</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection12">
<p>“Well, I kind of resented you and your family.”</p>

<p>Anger reared back up inside of Trevor at the words, but he fought it down. He didn't trust himself to say anything though, so he just left silence for Andy to fill.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t anything you did. You guys were great. You were always a good friend. Your parents were great to me, and to Trish, especially through the divorce. I remember me and her coming to your house for dinner whenever things were bad, which was all the time for a couple of years there. So, it certainly wasn’t fair to think the way I did, but I was jealous of you, jealous of your life. It seemed perfect when I compared it to mine. I had a couple of shitty parents that seemed to be doing everything in their power to ruin each other’s lives, and they didn’t seem to care if they ruined mine and Trish’s in the process. You know?” There was a note of pleading in Andy’s voice that pierced through Trevor’s anger.</p>
<p>Of course, he understood. He had always felt terrible for Andy and Trish. Their parent’s divorce had changed both of them. Andy had come back from the dark place he was headed.</p>
<p>Trish, well, she hadn’t been so fortunate.</p>

<p>And Trevor couldn’t forget that Andy had been there for him every time Trevor’s world had crumbled. Friendship’s like theirs weren’t built by harbouring grudges.</p>
<p>“Yeah man, I got you. We’re good, you know that,” Trevor said, reaching back to give Andy a small pat on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” Andy replied.</p>

<p>Trevor turned his attention back to his rod, giving it a small jiggle. It was odd they hadn’t caught anything yet, but fishing is like that sometimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection13">
<p>It was beginning to look like the sun might come out eventually. It had reached the midway point of its trip through the sky, but the cloud cover was sapping it of its warmth. The wind had died, so that the boat just sat there, not moving in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>Trevor felt a pang of hunger, so he reached down and unzipped the lunch kit. “You want some jerky?” he asked over his should as he reached down.</p>
<p>“I most certainly do.”</p>

<p>Trevor grabbed a couple of slabs of jerky, popping one into his mouth and passing the other one over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“No problem,” he replied, around a mouthful of dried meat. He tore a chunk off and began the mildly onerous task of chewing to the point where he could swallow it. He took a sip of beer to help with the process, which it did. When he finished the jerky, he reached down inside his jacket and pulled out a bag of Spitz. Opening the bag, he pulled out a handful of seeds and popped them into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Mhmhmmm?” he mumbled, holding the bag over his shoulder so that Andy could grab</p>

<p>it.</p>

<p>Andy grabbed the bag with a satisfied grunt. “Ah, you read my mind.” Trevor heard him fill his mouth and then felt the bag hit him in the shoulder. He grabbed it and tucked it back inside his jacket.</p>
<p>A small tug on his line caused him to jerk upright. He waited, tense and excited, for a stronger, more sustained pull. He waited like that for about ten seconds. And then another ten seconds. Finally, he sighed and relaxed, mildly dejected by his lures failure to entice the enormous fish that had just eyed it up.</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection14">
<p>“You should reel that back in and check the lure. A naked hook ain’t gonna do you much good,” Andy said.</p>
<p>Trevor knew Andy was right, but just that fact that he said it, as if Trevor did not know, made Trevor not want to do it. “Well, we don’t seem to be doing so great, regardless of how the hooks are set,” he said, as he reluctantly began reeling the line back in.</p>
<p>“That is unfortunately true. I might as well re-rig a worm while you got ‘em out. Mine's probably drowned or died of boredom by now."</p>
<p>Trevor watched as the red and white bobber steadily bobbed his way. Just as it came up to the side of the boat, the clouds gave way and a beam of sun caught him in the face. He smiled and squinted up at the welcome warmth. “Well, at least the sun has decided to join our little party.” He set his rod down against the side of the boat and pulled out the bait cooler. It was a small zipper cooler that had BAIT written in big black letters across the top. He unzipped it and pulled out a small plastic container labelled dew worms.</p>
<p>A strong earthy odour drifted into his nose as he pulled the white plastic lid off the clear container. He fingered around the rich brown dirt until he found a worm. He pulled it out and then passed the open container to Andy.</p>
<p>Brushing the dirt off the worm, Trevor began to set it on the hook in a manner that he hoped a trout would find appetizing. For a second, he thought about trying to think like fish, and then he thought about how stupid that was and let out a small chuckle.</p>
<p>There was a bump against his shoulder. “Here take this,” Andy said, trying to pass Trevor the bait container.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” Trevor replied, eyeing up his worm to make sure it was just right. “Man, take it. I got a wriggling critter that I want to get out of my hand here.”</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection15">
<p>“Well, figure it out. I’m just about to cast here.” “I’ll figure you out,” Andy mumbled behind him.</p>
<p>Satisfied with his rig, Trevor flipped the release, held his rod out to the side and cast out sidearm. The worm and bobber flew a good forty feet out from the boat and hit the water with a faint plop.</p>
<p>He set his rod between his feet and held his hand out behind him. “Alright, give me them worms.” The boat rocked as Andy shuffled around behind and then he felt the plastic container slide into his hand.</p>
<p>“’Bout time. What were you doin’ to that poor worm? You’re s’posed to put it on the hook, not make out with it,” Andy grumbled.</p>
<p>Trevor popped the lid back onto the container and placed it back in the cooler, then kicked the cooler back under the seat. “You’re just mad cuz I got mine into the water before you did. All them hungry fish are probably swarming around my hook. I’m gonna pulling ‘em in hand over fist before you even get your lure in the water.” He picked his rod back up and gave it a quick jiggle, but this time he used his left hand. You know, to switch up the luck.</p>
<p>“That will never happen.” “I guess we’ll see.”</p>
<p>Trevor sat there, hoping against hope that a fish would hit his line before Andy got his line in the water, but it wasn’t long before he heard Andy’s satisfied grunt and the whizz of his line spooling off the reel. There was a soft plop and then the click of Andy setting his release. There was a short silence and then a quiet but satisfied “Told you,” from Andy’s end of the boat.</p>
<p>Trevor just shook his head. The movement caused a bead of sweat to roll down his forehead. He looked back at the sun. It had completely burned the clouds away, revealing a</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection16">
<p>vibrantly blue, late-fall sky. It was oddly hot for this time of year but not unheard of. He set his rod back down and unzipped his heavy coat. He knew better than to jump the gun on taking it all the way off. It felt warm, that didn’t mean it was warm. Just meant it wasn’t cold. He had a wool shirt on underneath, but that wouldn’t keep him very warm in the thin mountain air.</p>
<p>He picked his rod back up and noticed that the warmth had caused the life around the lake to kick back up. He could hear bird calls from the woods surrounding them, and even a loon’s mournful wail in the distance. A flock of ducks went whistling overhead, getting in a late- season run before heading south for the winter.</p>
<p>There was a question wriggling around in Trevor’s head. It had come up while Andy was talking about his parent's divorce. He knew it was dangerous waters, but he had heard some rumours through the grapevine, and he wanted to know if there was any substance to them. “Hey man, you heard anything from Trish lately?” He absentmindedly jiggled his rod in the silence that followed the question.</p>
<p>A gust of wind kicked up and rocked the boat unexpectedly. Trevor shifted his feet and knocked over his beer that was sitting next to them. He reached down, grabbed the can, sipped the suds on the lip and then placed it between his legs.</p>
<p>“Why you asking about Trish?”</p>

<p>“Well you mentioned her a couple of minutes ago, and I heard some things over the last few weeks, so I figured I’d ask, see what’s up.”</p>
<p>“What did you hear?”</p>

<p>Trevor took a sip of his beer. He didn't want to get into who was saying what, that would only make things more complicated. But, there was something here. Andy wasn't usually this</p>

<p>cagey. “Not much, mostly just her name, but it came out of mouths I hadn’t heard say her name in years.” He took another sip of his beer and then put it back between his legs.</p>
<p>“She called,” Andy said.</p>

<p>Trevor blew out a sigh. “Jesus man, what’d she say?” This was big news. Everyone missed Trish. Her flight into the unknown had wreaked havoc on Andy’s family, and Trevor’s for that matter.</p>
<p>“Nothin’ much.”</p>

<p>Trevor frowned in disbelief. “What does that mean?” he asked. “I don’t know man, it’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Well, is she ok, or what?”</p>

<p>“She’s ok, for the most part. She’s, uh, well she’s coming back. Coming home.” Trevor smiled. “That is great news. When’s she coming back?” He turned to look at</p>
<p>Andy and noticed his friend was hunched over, head hanging down.</p>

<p>“Well, right now she is tying up loose ends and packing. We are hoping to have her here by the end of the month.”</p>
<p>“Where’s she gonna stay?”</p>

<p>“From what she tells me, she doesn’t have much money. So, Ellie and I talked it over, and we decided to put her up at our place, at least until she figures things out a little. Which might take a while."</p>
<p>That last bit caught Trevor’s ear. Andy wasn’t telling him something.</p>

<p>Trish was a touchy subject. After multiple stints in rehab, her mom had finally said enough and cut her off, and her dad had quickly followed suit. She had lived with Andy for a little while, but he had wanted to move in with Ellie, who was his girlfriend at the time. Trish</p>

<div class="WordSection18">
<p>had thrown a fit, saying that he was abandoning her when she needed him the most. Then she had gotten in a van with some of the deeply scummy dirtbags she called friends and headed off to the coast. That was three years ago, and that was the last they heard from her.</p>
<p>Trevor felt like Andy wanted to talk but something was holding him back. “What’d your parents say?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, they want her back, obviously, but it’s complicated.” “Why’s that?”</p>
<p>Trevor heard Andy sigh. “It just is man. I don’t want to talk about it.” “Why not?”</p>
<p>"Because I don't. Leave it, Trevor," Andy warned.</p>

<p>Trevor ignored the warning. “No, tell me. It’s obviously on your mind, get it out. If you can’t tell me, then who the hell are you going to tell? I care about her too. Is she ok?” He had already pushed this far, and they were going to have it out now whether Andy liked it or not.</p>
<p>“Like I said, kind of.” “What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means she’s pregnant. Like six months pregnant.”</p>

<p>The words crashed into Trevor’s brain, smashing all the words he had ready. He had not been expecting that. But even that didn’t make sense. Why would Andy hide that? “Is that all?” He realized he was afraid of the answer. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>“No.” Andy’s voice was heavy and low. It didn't sound like him at all, it seemed like he was struggling with himself, like part of him wanted to reach out to Trevor but the other part was holding him back.</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
</div>

<div class="WordSection19">
<p>“Why can’t you just drop it?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s obviously important. Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” Andy snapped. “She didn’t know she was pregnant until a few weeks ago,” Andy began and then stopped.</p>
<p>Understanding began to surface in Trevor’s mind and it brought with it a sick dread. He knew what his friend was going to say next and he knew why he struggling to get it out. He wanted to tell his friend that it was ok, he understood, but he knew that Andy needed to say it out loud.</p>
<p>Andy cleared his throat. "And uh, well she had been using the whole time up to that point. So, she has to go to a special clinic when she comes back, and hopefully, she won’t lose the baby, you know?”</p>
<p>Trevor could hear the tears in Andy’s voice. He turned around and squeezed Andy’s shoulder. At Trevor’s touch, Andy dropped his rod as a sob wracked his body. Trevor knew there was nothing to be said in the moment, he just had to be there. He sat there, tears pooling in his eyes, hand on Andy’s shoulder and listened to his friend cry until he was done. When he was ready, Andy reached up to his shoulder and grabbed Trevor’s hand. He gave it a gentle squeeze which Trevor returned.</p>
<p>Andy sniffed. “Sorry about that,” he said.</p>

<p>“You know better than to apologize for something like that.”</p>

<p>“I was talking about dropping the rod. Probably scared all the damn fish away.”</p>

<p>Trevor chuckled. “Yeah, that was uncalled for.” He set his own rod down and rubbed his face. The tears had left his face feeling dried out. He reached down and grabbed his beer and then chugged the last bit in one go. It was warm and flat. He grimaced at the taste then crushed</p>

<p>the can and tossed it into the bottom of the boat. He pulled the cooler back out, making sure to do it quietly this time. There was no ice left inside, only water, but the water was keeping the beer cold enough. He grabbed two cans and shoved the cooler back under the seat.</p>
<p>As Trevor passed the second can back to Andy, the details of what Andy had just told him settled into his mind and questions began to pop up. Instead of asking them, he took a sip of beer. "She's coming home, man. That's what matters." He picked up his rod again and gave it a half-hearted jiggle. A fish jumped not two feet from his bobber. Trevor began to think the fish were mocking him.</p>
<p>“I know, and I can’t wait until she’s here. But it’s gonna be tough.” “Yeah, but we’re tough people, we can handle it.”</p>
<p>“I know, trust me, I know. I’m just worried.”</p>
 
<p>Trevor nodded to himself. He was worried too. “What are you worried about?” He wasn’t going to put his worries on his friend, though, not right now.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about the baby.” Trevor heard Andy suck in a breath, trying to maintain control. “I mean, even if Trish doesn’t lose it, it’s still going to have her problems. It’s going to be born an addict.”</p>
<p>“Well, thank God it's going to have an uncle like you and an aunt like Ellie to help it along the way. You're good people, you're strong. And, you are surrounded by people who love you. I have always been there for you, and I will continue being there for you. This is why we have best friends. It's moments like these."</p>
<p>Trevor meant it. He couldn’t remember ever saying things like this out loud to Andy. He remembered telling him he loved him on his wedding day, but it wasn’t something they said to each other on a regular basis. But Trevor did remember crying on Andy’s shoulder the day his</p>
</div>
 
<p>father died. He remembered feeling devastated and scared, and he remembered Andy holding him up through those moments. And he remembered knowing that he would be there for Andy when he needed him.</p>
